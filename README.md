# ICT-Project
Introduction to Computer Technology was one of my major subjects of 1st Semester. In this subject we learned about the basic of Computer technology and it's evoluton as well as upcoming technologies.

# Easy Way
The main goal of our project was to create a website using the web development techniques we acquired in the ICT course.

## Brief Description
We showcased our front-end development skills in this project. The website is very basic as we were still just starting off with web development. The website's functionality was sufficient to enable for backward and forward movement. There is a homepage for the website, and it links to a number of other pages. The web pages were composed of a header that provided links to various sections of the page and a footer with buttons for navigating to the top of the page and useful social media handles. The homepage consisted of a "about" section, "services", "conact" section, and a mock responsive section. You can reach the other pages by clicking the button on the main page's section beneath the header.

## How to run the code?
You will be needing Visual Studios code and basic knowledge about HTML and CSS to navigate around the code.
